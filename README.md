Database-Utilities
==================

Helper that saves you time in managing your SQL Server database (2000, 2005, 2008)

Take a look at the quick tour in the video "tour.mp4"

You can:

- Filter tables by name or column name
- Check tables structure
- Generate a pre formatted stored procedures (CRUD)

- Filter Stored Procedures by name and input parameter names
- Automatically generate the C# code to call such procedure
- Add C# code to capture the output of a procedure into a class

Developed using Visual Studio 2010 in C# (.NET 4), using unit tests (with Rhino Mocks), MVVM, Dependency Injection and WPF.

I look forward for comments, suggestions, etc.
